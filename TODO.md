# TODO

* make it simpler to add new metrics, with both http and websocket routes
* hover details
* websocket disconnect/reconnect/error handling
* a better README
* make it "production-ready" (UWSGI, gunicorn, etc.)
* tests (of any kind lol)
* server-side caching of the last N data points
* better chart legends
* signal handling (`Ctrl-C` breakage)
* do some debug/trace logging in places
